<h3>My Top 3 Athletes</h3>
<h3>Kobe Bryant</h3>
<p>Kobe Bryant spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA straight out of high school. A dominant scorer, Bryant won five NBA championships and the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although later seasons were marred by injuries, he surpassed Michael Jordan for third place on the NBA all-time scoring list in December 2014 and retired in 2016 after scoring 60 points in his final game. In 2018, Bryant earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Dear Basketball.</p>
<h3>Terrell Owens</h3>
<p>The former wide receiver, who was born in Alexander City, Alabama, smashed numerous records during his 15-season career, amassed 15,934 yards for five teams, and was selected to six Pro Bowls. T.O. was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018 — but famously skipped the ceremony because of what he saw as a two-year delay in voting him in.</p>
<h3>Lionel Messi</h3>
<p>Lionel Messi, in full Lionel Andrés Messi, also called Leo Messi, (born June 24, 1987, Rosario, Argentina), Argentine-born football (soccer) player who received a record-setting seven Ballon d’Or awards as the world’s top male player (2009–12, 2015, 2019, and 2021). In 2022 he helped Argentina win the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)’s World Cup.</p>
